# DSA and Java Revision 🚀  
A collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java**, regularly updated with new concepts, code snippets, and patterns. This repository is designed for anyone revising DSA or preparing for coding interviews.  

---

## 📌 Features  
- ✅ **DSA Implementations:** Covers arrays, linked lists, recursion, sorting, searching, and more.  
- ✅ **Pattern Programs:** Includes popular pattern problems (Hourglass, Pyramid, etc.).  
- ✅ **Algorithm Implementations:** Covers sorting, searching, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.  
- ✅ **Competitive Programming:** Solutions to frequently asked coding problems in interviews & coding contests.  
- ✅ **Java Basics:** Covers OOP, exception handling, and core Java concepts.  
- ✅ **Regular Updates:** New codes are added frequently to keep the repo up to date.  
- ✅ **Beginner-Friendly:** Well-structured code with comments for easy understanding.  
- ✅ **Open for Contributions:** Feel free to add more optimized solutions and new DSA topics!
